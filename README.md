The "dice_game" program is a Python implementation of a simple dice game that can be played by two players. It allows players to choose a target number, and then rolls two 6-sided dice for a specified number of times. The program then determines which player wins by comparing the sum of the numbers rolled by each player to the target number. The game also has the capability to randomly choose the rolls, accounting for the probability of rolling each number, and then aggregate the sums of each player's rolls. The program outputs the result of the game, which can be won by either player if they roll the target number, or if they have the smallest sum of numbers rolled. If neither player wins or has the smallest sum, the game ends in a tie. The program also displays the numbers each player rolled given the specified number of rolls. This program can be useful for individuals looking to simulate a simple two-player dice game or teach programming students about conditional statements and the basics of random number generation.
